# NodeNetCore

This is the core package for NodeNet.  
It contains the core functionality of the NodeNet framework.  
  
For the best experience, it is **recommended** to use the **NodeNetCLI**  
`npm install @nodenet/cli --global` to create a new project.  
  
All needed packages and dependencies will be installed automatically.  
By default, NodeNet will not work by itself and needs other packages to work.


## Installation

```bash
npm install @nodenet/cli --global

nodenet new MyProject
```
